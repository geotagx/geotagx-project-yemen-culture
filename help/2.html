<p>With this quesiton we are trying to identify the site shown in the photo, this will help us create a photo database of the different cultural heritage sites in Yemen.</p>
<p>If you do not know the name of the site you can try looking at the image source (link under the photo) to see if there is any useful clues there.</p> 
<p>If there is nothing in the source, you could try searching for the photo using google's <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en">Reverse Image Search</a> to search for similar images on the internet. To use reverse image search, go to <a href="https://images.google.com/">Google Image Search</a> and click on the small camera icon in the search bar. On GeoTag-X, go to the image source, find the photo, right click on the image, and copy the image URL. Go back to Google Image Search and paste the URL into the search bar then hit Search by image.</p>
<p>Once you have a name for the site, type it into the text area and hit Done.</p>
<p>If, after saerching, you still are not sure of the name, select Don't Know</p>
